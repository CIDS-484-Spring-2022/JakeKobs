<h1>
  Retail Automation Toolkit

<div>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    I’m sure many, if not all of you, have registered for an account on a retail site, 
    such as Target or Walmart. This project focuses on those functionalities, but 
    in an automated approach. In the botting world, you need to generate hundreds of 
    accounts for a better chance at copping today’s most in demand items. If you were to 
    manually register for accounts, it would take many valuable hours, whereas with a registration bot, 
    all you need to supply is valid proxies, unique account usernames and passwords, letting the 
    registration software do all the heavy lifting for you.
